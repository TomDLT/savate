# About

This is a personal collection of tools to automatically save stuff during work.

It is based on a custom fork of <https://github.com/bartman/git-wip> and some personal code.

## Install

1. Clone the repository and install with `make`:

  ```console
  git clone https://github.com/tomdlt/savate.git
  cd savate
  python setup.py install
  ```

2. Copy `git-wip` in a place accessible by your path.
